# Spherical-Snake

WASD to turn

The screen is supposed to be black when you start. This is not a bug. If you wait, you will eventually see something.

You can view the spherical world [here](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/rtavenner/Spherical-Snake/blob/master/index.html).

There is an annoying flickering sometimes. I was unable to fix it.
